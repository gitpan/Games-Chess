NAME
    Games::Chess - represent chess positions and games

SYNOPSIS
        use Games::Chess qw(:constants);
        my $p = Games::Chess::Position->new;
        $p->at(0,0,BLACK,ROOK);
        $p->at(7,7,WHITE,ROOK);
        print $p->to_text;

DESCRIPTION
    The `Games::Chess' package provides the class
    `Games::Chess::Piece' to represent chess pieces, and the class
    `Games::Chess::Position' to represent a position in a chess
    game. Objects can be instantiated from data in standard formats
    and exported to these formats.

EXAMPLE
    To create a GIF of the opening position:

        use Games::Chess;
	my $p = Games::Chess::Position->new;
	open(GIF,">chess.gif") or die $!;
	print GIF $p->to_GIF;
	close(GIF);

PREREQUISITES
    Perl 5.004 or later.

    To create GIFs of chess positions, you need Lincoln Stein's "GD", a
    Perl interface to Tom Boutell's libgd graphics library.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && make install
